## Project Overview

AirFlow Intelligence is a web application that provides real time air quality monitoring and forecasting using NASA's TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions Monitoring of Pollution) satellite data. The app visualizes key pollutants, current Air Quality Index, weather conditions, and displays forecast charts to inform users about air quality trends.

## Features

- Real-time AQI and pollutant concentration display.
- Interactive location selector for easy switching between monitored cities.
- Detailed pollutant metrics covering NO₂, O₃, PM2.5, PM10, SO₂, and CO.
- Weather data integration for meteorological factors affecting air quality.
- AQI forecast visualization powered by NASA satellite and ML predictions.
- Smooth animations with glassmorphism UI design and responsive layout.
- Toast notifications for user interaction feedback.
- Error boundaries and graceful loading states for a robust user experience.
